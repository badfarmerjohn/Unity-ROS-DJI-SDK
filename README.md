# Unity-ROS-DJI-SDK
A ROSBridgeLib client for communicating with DJI's ROS wrapper for their Onboard SDK.

This repository is meant to be used as a submodule in a Unity project (under the Assets folder).
## Requirements
* A very specific fork of RosBridgeLib submodule must also be present in the project for this submodule to work: https://github.com/jeshlee121/ROSBridgeLib.git
